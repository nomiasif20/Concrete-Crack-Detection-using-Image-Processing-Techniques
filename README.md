# Concrete-Crack-Detection-using-Image-Processing-Techniques
 In this project, Image-based techniques like Canny Edge Detection and Sobel Filter are used to detect the concrete cracks from the images stored in the datasets to determine specific parameters, such as damage occurrence, severity, length of concrete cracks, and width of cracks.
